# What is mdtree?

**mdtree** is a small program that lists out all the Markdown files you have in a directory and gives you a preview of the contents of those files by listing out all their headers in a simple and clean way. 

# Example Usage

Simply just enter `mdtree` in any directory and you will see your Markdown files and previews of said files! 

Note that the mdtree executable located in the bin folder of this repository must be included in your path, otherwise your system will not be able to find the mdtree command.
