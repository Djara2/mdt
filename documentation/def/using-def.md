# What is def?

**def** is a program for creating [definition lists](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/deflists.html#:~:text=A%20definition%20list%20is%20a%20list%20of%20terms,is%20typically%20indented%20with%20respect%20to%20the%20term.) in Markdown. The format used does not work in all Markdown editors! It works in Joplin after enabling it in the settings; this program was designed with Joplin in mind. In the context of Joplin, it will generate Markdown that will render as a word (or series of words) that is/are bold and underlined, followed by its/their definition. 

# Example Usage

Commonly while taking notes for my classes in college, I will have to define a term, in which case I enter into my terminal `def apex cuboid` and in return I would get something like the following copied to my clipboard:

<dl>
	<dt><u><b>Apex Cuboid</b></u></dt>
	<dd>The top data cube - all data (no dimensions)</dd>
</dl>
